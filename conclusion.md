# Conclusion

The purpose of this thesis was to design and implement an application for immersive analytics. We have discussed the benefits of such applications and examined a couple examples of analytics software, immersive or otherwise. We then defined our user group and target platform and followed the user-centered design approach by creating three interconnected parts of our application over the space of three main design iterations. Over the course of development, feedback has been gathered and acted upon. We also went over the tools that were used during the prototyping and implementation stages and discussed the complexities of prototyping virtual reality applications.

The author wishes to continue improving the product after the conclusion of their studies. The first task on their list is to implement the real-time online infrastructure.
