# Future

In this chapter we will go over features that are going to form the focus of future development of our software.

## Plot types

So far, we have focused on scatter plots as a means to visualize our data. As part of development, we have also been able to test out bar plots and surface plots, which are going to be released alongside an update to Manager that will add support for data stored in two-dimensional matrices.

Additionaly, when it comes to multi-variate data, we would like to add support for visualizing geospatial data on either a plane or a globe, complete with satellite imagery, as well as support for parallel coordinate plots inspired by techniques discussed in a related paper.[1]

## Sharing system

## Brushing, linking

Brushing and linking techniques form an important part of any tool for interactive visualization. Brushing allows the user to select a subset of visualized data items with the goal of either emphasizing or deemphasising it in relation to other data. Linking allows for an extension of this functionality on other plots that are associated with the same dataset.[2]
