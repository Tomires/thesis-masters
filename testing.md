# Testing

The following table lists all KLM operations necessary to complete the task of creating a three-dimensional scatter plot as outlined in the second chapter. It presumes we are logged into Manager and have already associated a VR headset with our account.

| Operator | Description | Time (s) |
|---|---|---|
| M | Initiate opening a file | 1.35 |
| M | Find *Add new dataset* button on sidebar | 1.35 |
| PB | Point at the button and press it | 1.3 |
| PB | Select *Local file* | 1.3 |
| PB | Click on *Next* | 1.3 |
| PB | Click on *Select file* | 1.3 |
| PB | Select file and double click it | 1.3 |
| PB | Click on *Next* | 1.3 |
| M | Put on the VR headset with Navigator running | 1.35 |
| B | Display the data brush by holding the grip button  | 0.2[a] |
| PB | Point on a dataset and press the trigger | 1.3 |
| B | Hide the data brush by releasing the grip button | 0.2[a] |
| PBPB | Point on the ground and while holding the trigger select the scatter plot icon, then release the trigger | 2.6 |
| B | Display the data brush by holding the grip button | 0.2[a] |
| M | Locate the data brush | 1.35[b] |
| 2*(PBPB) | Drag attributes onto two of the spatial dimensions | 5.2 |
| PB | Rotate the plot | 1.3 |
| PBPB | Drag an attribute onto the remaining spatial dimension | 2.6 |
| PBPB | Drag an attribute onto the color dimension | 2.6 |
| B | Hide the data brush by releasing the grip button | 0.2[a] |
| PB | Point at the scale and press the trigger to slice the plot | 1.3 |

a. Only applies to 6DOF version
b. Only applies to 3DOF version

The total time necessary to complete the tasks is 29.55 seconds for 6DOF and 30.1 seconds for 3DOF versions, considerably faster than with contemporary tools introduced in chapter 2.
